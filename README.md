SUNLIST

For the last assignment in my coding bootcamp, I decided to build an application called Sunlist, which is a mix of a weather application and a to-do list. I had only 3 days to build this, so it was a challenge.

I originally used some YouTube tutorials to build two seperate apps, one for the weather and one for the to-do list. The challenge after building that was to see how I could fuse the two together.

After successfully putting the two together, I needed to change up the design to something original.

The name of the app reminded me of the Sunkist soft drink, so I chose to go with their well known tangerine color as well as celestial and catalina blue accents.

One feature I was hoping to include in the app was the ability to prioritise the to-do list. For that I will need react-table. I hope to implement this feature in the future.

The API for the weather app was sourced from https://openweathermap.org/api.

A 7 day forecast would have been nice, but the single day one is free of charge so I've gone with that for now.
